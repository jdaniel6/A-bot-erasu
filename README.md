# A-bot-erasu - A SMITE Bot

> Currently a WIP, new features are being added, and existing ones are being debugged.

A-bot-erasu is a Discord bot written in Node.js using the Discord.js wrapper, providing content for the popular MOBA, SMITE. A-bot-erasu is able to liven up chat with fun trivia games based off SMITE knowledge, and easily organise SMITE-themed events and custom games. 

A-bot-erasu uses data from the Hi-Rez API and was inspired by [SmiteWikiBot](https://github.com/DanBaileyGH/SmiteWikiBot).

This project was the author's first venture into the world of JavaScript, so some code may be inefficient or wonky. Suggestions are always welcome.
